# ML-Case-Study
About the Project:

Welcome to the realm of hands-on machine learning! In this open-ended ML Case Study, you have the opportunity to explore the vast landscape of machine learning applications across diverse industries. Your mission is to select one project from the list of projects given below in the cheat sheet or propose your own project idea that aligns with your interests and aspirations. This project is your canvas to apply your machine learning skills, experiment with various algorithms, and demonstrate your ability to tackle real-world challenges using data-driven insights. Through this project, you'll showcase your autonomy, creativity, and technical prowess as you contribute to shaping the future with data-driven solutions.
Skills Required:

Proficiency in Python programming.
Familiarity with data manipulation libraries (e.g., pandas,numpy).
Knowledge of data visualisation tools (e.g., matplotlib, seaborn).
Understanding of machine learning concepts and clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means).
Ability to analyse and interpret data insights.
Strong report writing and presentation skills.
